## Project Overview & Solution:
A three-wheeled vehicle is modeled and is visualized in gazebo simulator and RViz. The world file provided is mapped using Simeltaneous Mapping and Loacalization (SLAM) method. For Path planning RRT* and A* algorithms were used on the map generated and PID algorithm is used for control algorithm. 

### Vehicle Modelling
The vehicle is modeled in an urdf file.

### Mapping the world file
The orange_igvc.world world file is mapped using SLAM method with the help of Navigation2 stack of ROS2 and turtlebot3 robot.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2 ros-humble-nav2-bringup ros-humble-turtlebot3*
```
Go to the bashrc file and set TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle

Run the launch file to open the orange_igvc world file in gazebo and run the turtlebot3_teleop node to control the turtlebot3 robot. To visualize it in RViz the turtlebot3_cartographer is used and the map is saved using nav2_map_server

```bash
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f maps/maps2
```

```bash
cd maps
ls
```

On opening the .pgm file the map we get

### Path Planning

### Control Algorithm
PID algorithm is used
